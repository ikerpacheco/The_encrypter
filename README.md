### ENCRYPTION

- Message: the one you want. To test it you can try with "Just because I don’t care doesn’t mean I don’t
understand.".
- Key: the one you want. To test it you can try with "Homer S".
- Flag: 0.

This will return an encrypted message.

### DECRYPTION

- Message: the encrypted message received before.
- Key: the same key that the user used to encrypt the message (without this key, you won't be able to decrypt the message).
- Flag: 1.

This will return the original message.
